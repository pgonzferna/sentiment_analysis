# sentiment_analysis
This is my repo for doing a programming historian course: https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis#what-is-exploratory-data-analysis

This project is supported by Git and GitHub primarily in that I am able to sync my ongoing research output with a public-facing website. People can view how I developed my research tools (e.g., check the edit history of my code) and see the resulting data. My research can then be cited, reproduced, and built on by others.

When conducting sentiment analysis, it is important that my data corpus (i.e., the text I am computing against) is clearly versioned. GitHub will assist me in keeping track of the data that I am using to conduct my research.
